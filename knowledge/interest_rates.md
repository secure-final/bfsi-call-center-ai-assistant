## EMI Formula (Reducing Balance)

- **EMI** = P × r × (1+r)^n / ((1+r)^n − 1)
  - P = Principal
  - r = Monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12)
  - n = Number of installments

Example (sample only): Loan ₹5,00,000, 12% p.a., 36 months → r = 0.01, n = 36 → EMI ≈ ₹16,607.

## Prepayment and Foreclosure

- **Prepayment**: Allowed as per product; partial prepayment may have minimum amount.
- **Foreclosure**: Full repayment before tenure; charges if any are in the loan agreement.
- **Lock-in**: Some products have a lock-in period during which foreclosure may attract charges.

*Always refer to your loan agreement for exact terms.*
