        ("What are the documents required for a personal loan?", "For a personal loan you typically need: valid ID proof, address proof, last 3 months' salary slips or income proof, and bank statements. Self-employed applicants need IT returns and business proof. Specific requirements may vary by product; I can share the exact checklist for your loan type."),
        ("Where can I see my loan application status?", "You can check your loan application status by logging into net banking or our app under Applications > Loan Status, or by calling our helpline with your application reference number. You will also receive SMS/email updates at each stage."),
        ("My loan application was rejected. What should I do?", "We regret that your application was not approved. You may request the reason for decline from our customer care; common factors include credit score, income stability, or documentation. You can reapply after addressing these, typically after 6 months. We can also suggest alternative products if applicable."),
        ("How long does loan approval take?", "Standard processing time for most retail loans is 3 to 7 working days after we have received complete documents and the verification is done. Some products may have faster turnaround. You can track the status on our app or via the application reference number."),
        ("Can I apply for a loan if I have an existing loan?", "Yes, you can apply for another loan subject to eligibility. We consider your total obligations and repayment capacity. Having a good repayment history on the existing loan may support your application. The final decision is based on our credit policy."),
        ("What is the minimum salary for a personal loan?", "Eligibility criteria, including minimum income, vary by product and location. Please check the specific product page on our website or contact our helpline for the current criteria applicable to your city and employment type."),
        ("How do I know if I am eligible for a home loan?", "Home loan eligibility is based on age, income, existing obligations, credit score, and property value. You can use the eligibility calculator on our website or app, or visit a branch for a quick assessment. I can guide you through the steps if you tell me your preferred channel."),
        ("I want to check my loan eligibility without affecting my credit score.", "Checking eligibility on our app or website uses a soft inquiry that does not impact your credit score. A formal application involves a hard inquiry. I recommend using our eligibility checker first to see indicative amounts and terms."),
        ("What is the maximum loan amount I can get?", "The maximum loan amount depends on your eligibility, income, existing loans, and the product. Use our eligibility calculator on the app or website for an indicative amount, or speak to a relationship manager for a detailed assessment."),
        ("Do I need to be salaried to apply for a personal loan?", "We offer personal loans to both salaried and self-employed individuals. Documentation and criteria differ slightly. Salaried applicants need salary slips and employment proof; self-employed need IT returns and business proof. I can list the exact documents for your profile."),
        ("How can I increase my loan eligibility?", "You can improve eligibility by maintaining a good credit score, reducing existing debt, showing stable income, and adding a co-applicant if the product allows. Avoiding late payments and keeping a healthy savings history also help. I can suggest steps based on your situation."),
        ("What is the age limit for applying for a loan?", "Age criteria vary by product. Generally, the applicant should be at least 21 years and the loan should be fully repaid before retirement age (typically 60–65). Some products have different limits. Please check the product terms or ask for the specific loan type you need."),
        ("Can I get a loan without a credit score?", "First-time borrowers may not have a credit history. We may still consider the application based on income, employment, and other factors. Building a credit history with a small loan or credit card can help. Contact our branch or helpline for options available to new-to-credit customers."),
        ("How do I track my loan application?", "Track your application using the reference number sent to you via SMS/email. Log in to our app or net banking and go to Applications > Loan Status, or call our helpline and provide the reference number. You will see stages like received, under verification, approved, or disbursed."),
        ("What is the difference between pre-approved and applied loan?", "A pre-approved offer is based on our assessment of your relationship and eligibility; you can accept it with minimal documentation. An applied loan is when you submit a formal application that goes through full verification. Pre-approved loans often have faster processing."),
        ("Why was my loan application put on hold?", "Applications may be put on hold if we need additional documents, clarification on income or employment, or property verification (for secured loans). Check the status message on the app or contact us with your reference number; we will specify what is required to proceed."),
        ("Can I apply for a loan online?", "Yes, you can apply for most retail loans online through our website or app. You will need to fill the form, upload documents, and complete e-signature where applicable. You can also visit a branch if you prefer in-person support."),
        ("What is the processing fee for a personal loan?", "Processing fees vary by product and are disclosed at the time of application. They are typically a percentage of the loan amount or a fixed charge. Please check the product page or your loan agreement for the exact fee. No fee is charged for checking eligibility."),
        ("How many co-applicants can be there for a home loan?", "For home loans, we typically allow one or two co-applicants, often family members, to improve eligibility and share liability.

        ("How is EMI calculated?", "EMI is calculated using the loan amount, interest rate, and tenure. The formula is: EMI = P × r × (1+r)^n / ((1+r)^n − 1), where P is principal, r is monthly interest rate, and n is number of installments. You can use the EMI calculator on our app or website for your loan."),
        ("Where can I see my EMI schedule?", "You can view your EMI schedule in the loan section of our app or net banking. It shows each installment date, principal and interest split, and outstanding balance. You can also request a statement from the branch or via customer care."),
        ("What is my next EMI date?", "Your next EMI date is mentioned in your loan account summary in the app or net banking, and in the SMS/email reminders we send. If you share your loan account number (masked), I can guide you to the exact screen where it is displayed."),
        ("Can I change my EMI date?", "EMI date change is subject to product policy. Some loans allow a one-time date change; others are fixed. Please contact our customer care or visit the branch with your loan details to check if your product permits this and what the process is."),
        ("What happens if I miss an EMI?", "Missing an EMI may attract late payment charges and impact your credit score. We send reminders before the due date. If you have missed a payment, please pay at the earliest and contact us to regularise the account. Continued defaults can lead to stricter recovery steps as per the loan agreement."),
        ("How can I pay my EMI?", "You can pay EMI through auto-debit (if set up), net banking, our app, NEFT/IMPS to the loan account, or at any branch. Ensure you use the correct loan account number and pay before the due date to avoid charges."),
        ("Can I increase my EMI amount to close the loan early?", "Yes, many loan products allow prepayment or higher EMI to reduce tenure or outstanding. Prepayment rules and any charges are in your loan agreement. You can request the change through the app, net banking, or by visiting a branch."),
        ("What is the difference between reducing balance and flat rate?", "In reducing balance method, interest is calculated on the outstanding principal each month, so effective interest reduces over time. In flat rate, interest is on the full principal for the entire tenure. Our retail loans typically use reducing balance. Your agreement specifies the method."),
        ("How do I get an EMI certificate?", "You can download the EMI or loan statement from the app or net banking under Loan Details > Statements. For a stamped certificate, visit the branch or request through customer care. It will show installment details and payment history."),
        ("Why did my EMI amount change?", "EMI usually changes only if there is a rate change (in floating-rate loans), you did a restructuring, or you made a partial prepayment and chose to reduce EMI. Check your loan account for any such updates or contact us with your loan number for clarification."),
        ("What is the minimum EMI I can pay?", "Minimum EMI is determined by the loan amount, tenure, and interest rate. For a given loan, the EMI is fixed as per your agreement. To lower EMI you may need to extend tenure (if allowed) or make a partial prepayment and restructure; product rules apply."),
        ("Can I get a holiday on EMI?", "Some products offer an EMI holiday or moratorium for a short period at the start; this is product-specific. General EMI holidays are not standard. In genuine hardship cases, we may consider restructuring as per policy. Please contact our customer care or branch to discuss options."),
        ("How do I set up auto-debit for EMI?", "You can set up auto-debit through net banking or the app under Loan > Auto-debit, by linking your savings account and authorising the mandate. Ensure sufficient balance before the due date. You can also set up NACH with your branch."),
        ("What is included in my EMI?", "Your EMI typically includes a principal component and an interest component. In the initial months, the interest portion is higher; over time the principal portion increases. Insurance or other add-ons, if any, are as per your loan agreement."),
        ("How many EMIs are left on my loan?", "The number of remaining EMIs is shown in your loan account summary on the app or net banking, along with the outstanding principal. You can also request a statement from customer care or the branch."),
        ("Can I pay two EMIs together?", "Yes, you can pay more than one EMI in a single payment. The extra amount will go towards principal (prepayment) or advance EMIs as per our policy. This may reduce tenure or future EMI burden. Check your loan terms for prepayment rules."),
        ("What is the tenure of my loan?", "Your loan tenure is stated in the sanction letter and in the app under loan details. It is the number of months over which you repay the loan. Any change due to prepayment or restructuring will reflect in the updated schedule."),
        ("Why is my first EMI higher?", "The first EMI can be higher if the loan has a different start date (e.g. part-month interest), or if it includes processing fee or insurance premium. Check your first installment breakdown in the app or in the welcome letter; contact us if you need a detailed explanation."),
        ("How do I know my loan is fully paid?", "When the outstanding principal reaches zero and all dues are cleared, the loan is closed. You will see this in the app/net banking and receive a closure letter or NOC. Keep the NOC for your records and to release any collateral if applicable."),
        ("What is the outstanding balance on my loan?", "Your outstanding balance is visible in the loan section of the app or net banking. You can also get it via SMS by sending the keyword to our number, or by calling customer care with your loan account number. It is updated after each payment."),

Fixed rates stay constant for the agreed term; floating rates change with the benchmark. I can explain the difference in detail if you tell me your loan type."),
        ("How often do floating rates change?", "Floating rates are linked to a benchmark and reset as per the product terms—typically every quarter or as per the agreement.

You would have received a communication for any change. Check the app or your last statement for the current rate; we can explain the reason if you contact us."),
        ("What is the penalty for late EMI payment?", "Late payment charges are as per your loan agreement and may be a fixed amount or a percentage of the overdue amount. Paying on time helps avoid these charges. Please refer to your agreement or contact us for the exact charges applicable to your loan."),
        ("Is there a penalty for foreclosing the loan?", "Prepayment or foreclosure charges, if any, are mentioned in your loan agreement.

        ("Do you charge interest on the processing fee?", "Processing fee is typically a one-time upfront charge and not usually financed as part of the loan. Interest is charged on the disbursed loan amount. Please refer to your loan agreement or the product terms for exact details."),
        ("What is the rate for education loans?", "Education loan rates are product-specific and may vary by institute, course, and profile. Please check our education loan page on the website or app for current rates, or contact our education loan desk for the latest information."),

        ("What is the benchmark for my floating rate loan?", "The benchmark (e.g. repo-linked or MCLR-linked) is stated in your loan agreement. When the benchmark changes, your rate is reset as per the spread mentioned in the agreement. You can find this in the loan terms or by contacting us."),
